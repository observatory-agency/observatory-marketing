## Overview

As a leading consultant for boutique fitness studios, Spark Strategies approached us looking to build out their digital presence with a professional website and content hub.

The website would serve as both a lead generation tool and a resource hub for fitness studio owners looking to grow their businesses. Because their reputation depended on having a premium digital presence, we focused on creating a fast, responsive site with excellent UX.

We developed a custom content management system that allows them to easily publish new articles, case studies, and resources. The site architecture was designed to highlight their expertise and make it easy for potential clients to understand their services.

To optimize their search traffic, we implemented an SEO strategy focused on industry-specific keywords and created content pillars around the core challenges faced by fitness studio owners.
